Mission Control pics

Make existing missions stand out, to make the impression. Batteries included: We've already got over a dozen missions in the planning stages, all of them founded on the MetaMission. Some of these missions are ready to start funding now, but Mission CTRL needs catalyst funding to enable that functionality. Any sales in this catalyst funding phase that exceed the funding target will go into the treasury and then get poured into missions later according to consensus (see Catalyist Funding).

The MetaMission Statement
Stage: Funding

Purpose-driven crowdfunding, development and operations for people working in
the real world.

We're marshalling the entire world's decentralized workforce to accomplish our shared missions, right there out in the open.

This is Your Call to Action
  Folks, it's time to get to work.
  
  Do you want to work on real-world projects to help people in need -- such as
  those in poverty, disaster survivors, the homeless, the children without
  hope -- to get busy fixing the problems rather than bickering over policies,
  worldiews and private agendas? If so, this is your call from Mission CTRL to
  report for duty.

Mission CTRL is for helpers, builders, teachers and pioneers. We're all about
getting boots on the ground today to accomplish the missions we all want to
achieve in the world. Your own missions can be world-changing or just for fun.
Mission CTRL is designed for versatility, based around a concept of missions
that can suit projects ranging from decentralized global energy management to
a child cleaning her bedroom. Versatility is one of the happy consequences of
making compassion for human life the spearhead of our mission: Because love
alone accomplishes all good missions.

Mission CTRL practices Principled Pioneering, where local residents get
empowered with self-determination and funding, for the benefit of all.

What if the whole world got on mission for a change? We want to see the day
when everyone is reporting, "I'm with Mission CTRL."

Looking for fundamentals, innovation and real-world value? Mission CTRL
delivers on all counts, and much more. Join Mission CTRL today as a Supporter
and then take action: Level up to Worker, Builder-Operator or Missionary -- and
let's change the world together.

MetaMission Statement
  Our mission is to establish the foundation for more missions to come, so we
  call this our MetaMission:
  
  All of us know the right thing to do, so let's agree to do the right thing
  together, without dispute, and with joy and loving kindness to all, and to
  stay on this MetaMission, in all ways and at all times.

Introduction
  We're on a mission, and we want everyone to join us.
  
  Mission CTRL is a DAO, using native utility token CTRL, along with an
  application, that exists to empower local communities, and to support all the
  workers striving to achieve our shared mission.

  CTRL is pronounced "Control," and it means Control, as in Mission Control.
  It's also that key on your keyboard. Most importantly,

  For the MetaMission, CTRL stands for:

  Conscience - which means "with" + "knowledge"
  Truth      - that which cannot lie
  Reality    - that which exists
  Love       - also known as Life, which regeneratively earns rewards for all

  These are the guiding principles that inform our MetaMission.

  Mission CTRL spreads the love through good works, thereby generating more
  love and good works. It's a beautiful expression of life (and much more), and
  we want you to participate in it.
  
  The MetaMission is the one mission in the world that's out of this world.

Participation Levels
  Level 1: Supporter - Every holder of CTRL at any amount.
  Level 2: Worker - An active worker for Mission CTRL in some capacity.
  Level 3: Builder-Operator - A person making and running things IRL and online.
  Level 4: Missionary - Someone who hears the call and responds, "Send me."

Participation Rewards
  Higher levels earn all the rewards of lower levels.
  
  Level 1: Lotteries + Mission Accomplished Bonuses
  Level 2: Tips
  Level 3: On Delivery (by contract)
  Level 4: Daily (by contract)

Consensus
  Mission CTRL makes decisions by consensus, with Participation Level determing
  if someone is eligibile to vote within the various Voting Domains, as well
  as their relative voting power in those domains. This prevents the
  disproportionate influence of money over mission objectives, and incentivizes
  participation by increasing voting power (the right kind of power, earned
  through participation in the mission) rather than only monetary earnings.

Voting Domains
  Monetary Policy     - Level 1
  DAO Functionality   - Level 1
  Mission Planning    - Level 2
  Mission Funding     - Level 2
  Mission Deployment  - Level 2
  Mission Operations  - Level 3
  Mission Prerogative - Level 4

Mission Prerogative
  Mission Prerogative is the power to make unilateral decisions regarding
  mission operations on a moment-by-moment basis, provided that all such
  decisions are disclosed in that day's Mission Log. Mission CTRL, working in
  the Level 2 Voting Domain, then votes to either formalize such a
  decision-made-by-prerogative, or to remediate the issue somehow. As for
  remediation, it's hardly in the spirit of the MetaMission to condemn any
  missionary for making difficult decisions under pressure. Remediation will be
  entirely focused on getting back on mission, with the missionary foremost in
  leading that effort.

Catalyst Funding
  Given that this mission is building the structural and crowdfunding support
  for other missions, it must leverage a bootstrapping technique to crowdfund
  itself and launch the first missions. For this purpose, we've created the
  Bootstrap Fund, which is a small allocation of CTRL to be cashed out when it
  reaches a preset funding target.

CTRL Tokenomics
  The strategy is to use the same native token for catalyst funding that we'll
  use as a utility token for running the DAO. We'll call these two modes
  Catalyst Phase and Operational Status.
  
  Catalyst Phase
    We'll first mint a very large surplus of CTRL, priced at $1 USD. The huge
    market cap means that total supply of CTRL won't run out before reaching
    Operational Status. A target amount of CTRL will then be allocated for
    catalyst funding, called the Bootstrap Fund. The Bootstrap Fund will cash
    out for mission use when it reaches its target, thus providing the startup
    capital needed by Mission CTRL to reach Operational Status.
    
  Operational Status
    Operational Status is the ongoing status of CTRL as a utility token for
    Mission CTRL. At the point of reaching Operational Status, the DAO is
    managing all the CTRL tokenomics according to that defined by Mission 3.

  1,000,000,000 (1T) minted
  Priced at $1 USD
  Market Cap: $1,000,000,000 ($1T)
  
  The first 50,000 CTRL will be allocated to the Bootstrap Fund with a target
  of $50,000.

  The remaining supply of CTRL (950,000,000 tokens) will be sold on the open
  market. Expect the price of CTRL to remain at $1 throughout the Catalyst
  Phase, unless supporters have maxed out the market cap of $1 trillion USD. Do
  keep in mind that even in such an unlikely scenario, the Bootstrap Fund is
  limited to cash out at its target of $50,000. Only the supporters of Mission
  CTRL would be getting rich, and at that point, the supporters would be a
  large and diverse collection of the world's population. Furthermore, given
  the MetaMission, much of this wealth enjoyed by Mission CTRL supporters would
  get anonymously gifted back to missions.

  Mission CTRL, the DAO, will be built and put in charge of managing the supply
  of CTRL (mint/burn) as well as the treasury for funding operations and new
  development. Mission 3 is all about this work.

Mission Stages
  Not all of these stages will be applicable to every mission. Indeed, some missions
  are open-source software development projects, including this mission.

  Pre-Planning - Pitch a new mission, see if it can fly
  Planning - Further analysis and preparation for success
  Funding - Create the Mission Fund and allocate CTRL to cover the budget
  Training - Understanding and practicing what it will take for team success
  Launch Status Check - The required go/no go consensus poll. May require a Launch Code, held by another mission until ready.
  Deployment - Set off on the adventure of a lifetime. May God's love be with you.
  Landing (not literal) - Greet the locals, setup camp (or hotel room, or apartment, etc.)
  Life Support - Ensure the health and safety of missionaries and locals alike. Preservation of life and health is always the missionary's priority one, but at this stage, and depending on the mission, it could be an extensive and extended full-time effort.
  Local Empowerment - Empower the locals to self-govern using their own crypto
  Establishment - Setup a base of operations with local consent
  Development - Accomplish key mission objectives. Could be iterative, periodic.
  Cleanup - Leave no trace, even cleaner than when you landed. For software missions, this could include cleaning up technical debt and putting an ongoing devs/operations plan together (we suggest launching more missions!).
  Dispersal - Say farewell to the locals and scram. For crypto missions, this means achieiving decentralization and giving up the keys.
  Mission Accomplished - We celebrate and share our joy by giving gifts
    The MetaMission mandates real charity, becaues charity means love.
    Look it up.
    This is the opportunity to share your harvest, anonymously.
    An almost impossible task for the rich man, and yet possible.
    You can tip Mission CTRL workers, as always, or give over lump sums to
    missions, as always.

  This mission, the MetaMission of Mission CTRL, is following these stages now, although they're not programmatically driven (see Mission 3). The MetaMission has now reached the Funding Stage, and you're looking at the product of the Planning
  Stage. Stages such as dispersal are not on the roadmap, as the MetaMission is built to keep on going.

Local Empowerment Fund
  Missionaries in the field draw a daily reward, at a rate established during the mission planning phase. If the CTRL token appreciates above the exchange rate at the time of the missionary's deployment, the excess amount will flow automatically into a fund dedicated to Local Empowerment for that mission.

  Often, the mission will call for minting a native token for the natives (!)
  and channeling the money in the Local Empowerment Fund to their new DAO,
  which then controls all spending by self-governance and consensus. This is
  the case with Mission 2 (see SLABDAO), for example.
  
  Furthermore, the locals are empowered (and encouraged) to start their own missions using their own native token and DAO, and we'll gladly help them.
  Again, this is the case with Mission 2 (see Builder's Paradise), where
  missionaries help the residents of Slab City start their own enterprises, leasing land to foreigners, and then offering customers everything from infrastructure and construction to supply chain logistics and international commerce -- to make everyone's greatest dreams reality, on the ground, for the mutual benefit of all IRL.

Validation
  Validators are randomly-chosen people on the mission field at Level 2 or
  higher who anonymously check that recipients of Mission CTRL funding are
  executing on mission. This is DeQA: Decentralized Quality Assurance. This
  would include validating the work of missionaries, of course, but also the
  builders, suppliers, visitors or anyone else who gets involved with the
  project. You can decline with no reason given, with no negative consequences,
  and Mission CTRL will try to find another volunteer at random, anonymously.

Missionary Life
  Before deploying to the mission field, you'll need to get a whole lot of your
  personal matters in order, and Mission CTRL has you covered. Whether it's
  planning out special medical or dietary needs, making family arragements,
  storing your belongings, dealing with debt obligations... Whatever it is,
  we'll help you get on mission.
  
  You can take along any small personal items with you, but you'll need
  nothing special except your willingness and ability to accomplish your
  mission.
    
  Upon deployment, Mission CTRL begins giving you a daily reward in the amount
  you found agreeable during the mission planning stage.

  In addition, Mission CTRL handles the following needs for you:

  Upon landing (if not before deployment), 
    Drinking water and non-alcoholic beverages
    Groceries of your choosing
    Toiletries, towels
    Quality clothing and gear that's suitable for your mission and conditions
    Luggage for clothes, a backpack for the rest
    Misc small tools, utensils, solar flashlight, emergency kit, etc.
    Camping gear (if applicable)
    All the awesome Mission CTRL gear
    Communications devices, service and charging ability, with redundancy
    Locker and combo lock for all your stuff
    
  Upon the establishment of your base of operations,
    A regular schedule, with time allocated for your personal use.
    A place to store your things and sleep in comfort and maximum safety.
    A clean restroom and hot shower

  Do keep in mind that while Mission CTRL provides all these things for you,
  it may just be part of your mission to go out and get these things for
  yourself! As a missionary, you are also part of Mission CTRL, after all.

  The daily life of a missionary depends entirely on the mission and the
  missionary, but a few things are regular:
  
  You will work
  You will have free time
  You will eat and drink
  You will rest
  You will send in your daily Mission Logs!

Mission Logs
  These are the daily pings required of missionaries, to inform Mission CTRL
  that all systems are executing as planned. It can be as simple as a
  thumbs-up emoji or as detailed as a 1-hour video of you gushing about how
  much fun you're having. If you have nothing missionary-related to report,
  feel free to use your logs as a platform for blogging, videos or anything
  else you want to publish to all your fans cheering you on at Mission CTRL.

Analytics
  We can easily quantify achievements such as Local Empowement,
  gifting, things built and delivered, missions accomplished, as well as any
  mission-specific metrics. We'll show all these metrics in realtime on the
  CTRL Panel, along with lots of other stuff.
  
CTRL Panel
  The landing page for this website, mctrl.io, is currently static. This will
  be replaced by the CTRL Panel, a single-page app. See Mission 3 for
  ongoing developments.

Private Missions
  Some missions are private and shouldn't be shared with the world. Thankfully,
  Mission CTRL helps to guide and keep missions on the MetaMission whether
  public or private, which is winning. Here are a few example use cases:
  
  Roommates are on a mission to pay their shared monthly bills. There will be
  rewards.
  
  A child is on a mission to keep his room clean. There will be rewards.
  
  A couple is on a mission to fix their broken relationship. There will be
  rewards. Indeed, such a couple could put out a call for another missionary,
  a relationship counselor, to help.

Mission CTRL Store
  Branded gear to properly equip you for any mission.
  Available only in the Mission CTRL Store.
  Offering the same high-quality utility gear that Mission CTRL uses in the
  field. Best part is, when you buy the gear, you become part of Mission CTRL
  as a supporter, making it legit for you to rock that logo anywhere you go.

Mission Insignias
  Each mission gets an insignia to use as a logo online and for branding the mission's patches, gear, stickers, mugs... all the merch. Missions can make NFTs for sale in the Mission CTRL Store too.

Insignia Contest
  Mission CTRL desperately needs an insignia to give this project an inspirational, unifying, concrete theme, and we don't think this work should wait on Mission 3 to launch and do it. Therefore, the founders have decided to offer a reward of 500 CTRL ($500) for the best Mission CTRL insignia, to be awarded in the same week the Bootstrap Fund reaches its goal. Founders reserve the right to take a pass on all submissions, but a favorite will be selected and awarded 500 CTRL nonetheless.
  
  This is your chance to have your design serve as the front-facing image of
  Mission CTRL worldwide. This is also the time to think about the greater
  theme, and the need down the line for new insignias for workers at the
  different Participation Levels and such. We hope that 500 CTRL will inspire
  the artist(s) to work with us to hone the work to enhance the Mission CTRL
  vision.

  We need lots of graphic art in general. The art should be fun and
  adventurous, because missions should be fun and adventurous a lot of the
  time, yet stay fully on mission, keeping with the serious project-oriented
  utility of Mission CTRL. It's a delicate balance. Here are some words to
  summarize the aesthetic: Bold, adventurous, compassionate, well-equipped.
  Use the early NASA mission insignias for inspiration, but don't use the
  rockets-leaving-earth imagery, since Mission CTRL is dedicated to serving
  people on earth.

The Story of Fox and Raven (Founders)

   fox@trqoiz.com
         &
  raven@trqoiz.com

  Fox and Raven are married, and they go on adventures together. Fox has been
  coding since he was kid, but Fox is 50 years old now, so that means he's been
  coding for many, many milliseconds. Raven is already busy working on missions, and together they're taking it on the road, going global, to everyone, wherever they are, and doing the work they've been called to do.

  My name is Otter: , and they call me the testy reporter with a heart of gold. Welcome to my blog. Here's what we know about the founders of Mission CTRL, based on what I was able to find.

  Fox and Raven study the Bible together, and they pray together, asking God to guide them, and to put them on mission to do His work. God has indeed guided them, blessing their marriage and their lives, empowering them by His Holy Spirit to seek His will, denying their own selfish desires, to preach the gospel and to walk the walk with His Son, Jesus Christ, with love toward all. Sounds difficult, but with God it's easy.

  Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head" (Luke 9:58b).

  "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me" (Matt 16:24).

  With those verses in mind, the mission of Fox and Raven was thus put before them like a lighted path, and because they were prepared and equipped to go, they eagerly answered back, "Lord, send us," thus sealing their covenant before God, the world and everyone.

  Since the time of those events, not long ago, when Fox and Raven entered the Development stage of this new great mission, the MetaMission as it became to be known to the world, God has only been giving them more and more, enabling their mission to go further and further.

  I visited Fox at his hole in the desert outskirts of California to ask him some questions.

  Otter: It's very hot and dry over here.
  
  Fox: Hello, Otter. Thank you for visiting. I hope that tub full of cold water is treating you right.

  Otter: It's keeping me from leaving, if that's important to you.

  Fox: Make yourself at home.

  Otter: Thank you, I will. Do you have any questions before we get started?

  Fox: Yes, I do have a question. Why do they call you the testy reporter with a heart of gold?

  Otter: That's a little bit personal, bro.

  Fox: I'm sorry.

  Otter: I mean, I don't come into your house and start demanding answers about your personal life.

  Fox: Actually, you literally just did that.

  Otter: Look, bro, I'm about to lose my cool all over you. Step up to my tub if you're feeling all feisty, Fox.

  Fox: I thought Otters were always cool.

  Otter: That's what my therapist keeps telling me, but then again, my therapist is a snake. I call him Dr. Slinky Shrinky. To his face, and he takes it because I'm paying him.
  
  Fox: Please stop splashing water at me.

  Otter: It's getting me through this interview. Let's get started, shall we?

  Fox: Yes, please.

  Otter: What's the greatest mission that you want to see achieved on earth? And don't use this as an excuse to start Bible thumping.

  Fox: Wow. Okay. Let me think. That's a tough one to sum up. No Christiaity allowed here? That's cold... Okay, got it. For me, I'll declare Mission Accomplished when the world affirms what a shameful waste it's been to pour our time and treasure into the Metaverse, spiraling ever deeper into our own imaginations through VR and fake worlds with nothing good to bring into the real world -- in fact, usually seeking departure from the real world -- when we should've been on MetaMission the whole time.

  Otter: I see what you did there, trying to encode your Christian faith into something even I can agree with.

  Fox: Yes, Otter, even you can agree with the MetaMission.

  Otter: That's nice to know, but I already knew all that, and you're getting us off track. Please tell my readers why you're qualified to code all this stuff and save the world for everyone.

  Fox: First of all, I'm no savior, and secondly, I'm hardly going to code everything myself. I can't wait to fully decentralize this open-source megaproject, and missions allow for this naturally. As for me and coding...

  I don't remember coding my first program, but I remember writing a Blackjack game in BASIC on a Tandy Pocket Computer. Wish I could find that thing. Later, in my teens, I learned about C++ and studied object-oriented programming for a few years, for no particular reason other than it gave me joy. Then I went to
  college and majored in creative writing and literature, which also gave me
  joy, and I ignored computers until my final year. You could still ignore
  computers in the early 90s. What happened in my final year to bring me back
  to computers was, I was broke.
  
  Since I typed at 100 WPM, which is nothing special today among serious
  computer folk, and since every business was furiously hiring temps to do
  data entry, I checked out the job board at school for any typing jobs. This
  was a literal board on the wall, to be clear, though I did run a BBS in the
  late 80s.
  
  There on that board I found an offer that changed everything: an internship at
  Borland International if you know C++. Gee, I knew some C++.
  
  And so I was no longer broke. Not even close. I dropped out of college and
  went on some crazy startup adventures. Then I settled down and did
  contracting, then some startups again, then more contracting. Long story
  short, I became an enterprise software architect instead of a writer and
  English teacher.
  
  In terms of my favored programming languages, C++ gave way to Java, then
  Scala, and ultimately Haskell. Some people prefer or need to be versatile,
  but for me, when it comes to my own coding now, I'm a Haskeller.
  
  Speaking of Haskell, I thank God for Cardano and what they're doing. In general, I conclude at this point that the spirit of the Cardano project is executing on MetaMission. I'm all in, and on a mission to help grow Cardano's technology, its community and its usage in helping people IRL. See especially Missions 5, 9 and 14 -- these missions are designed to bring real value to Cardano.
  
  And speaking of God, here's another thing. In 2013, I decided to reject
  technology and the whole system (it's complicated), so I checked out, bought
  an old brick building (old for the US, 1869) and opened a used bookstore full
  of antiques. Just me and my dog, in a town of about 2,000 country folk. I was
  busy doing research for a cynical novel I was writing about religion, when at
  midnight on New Year's Eve 2014-2015, my Lord Jesus Christ saved me. And I
  never saw it coming. I was at the top of my game, and then God intervened, convicted me, and changed everything for me. I'm completely transformed, given new life. I had been an atheist and an active, demonstrating anarchist all my life (I hope this shows in my continued attention to preserving our personal freedoms), and I didn't even know a single Christian.
  
  Now God, through His Son Jesus Christ, has led me to go on this mission here.
  That's MY statement of dedication to Mission CTRL, before all of you, and
  before my Lord.
  
  Founders of crypto projects often assure their backers by saying they're doxxed. Well, I'm doxxed in that sense (@ismashrobots), but I also have this fact to bring to your attention, which you can also bank on: I confess to being doxxed before God, and so I'm one motivated fella to follow my Lord Jesus Christ in every word, thought and deed. If you've read this far, you know that means I'm already on MetaMission with all I've got.

  Otter: You really went off there.

  Fox: Sorry.

  Otter: It's cool. But you could've said all that in chat and saved me a trip to your hole in the desert. Where's your bird-wife?

  Fox: Raven.

  Otter: Yeah, I know. A Raven's a bird, bro. And she's your wife, right? Bird, wife. Bird-wife.

  Fox: Have it your way, Otter.

  Otter: Yes, let's have it my way and get back to the important questions. Is Mission CTRL a Christian organization?

  Fox: No, but the MetaMission is founded upon biblical principles because its
  framers, Fox and Raven, are Christians who seek God's will for directing
  their path. Christianity is the life-blood of Mission CTRL, by design, like
  it or not, while the body of Mission CTRL follows the collective free will
  of all its members, through consensus and personal prerogative.

  Perhaps another matter of trivia to unbelievers is that the MetaMission is
  our codification of Jesus' call to repent. The Metamission is the Christian walk, expressed in a way that everyone can follow because it's guided by their God-given conscience, otherwise known as compassion, having a heart, loving.
  
  Lord willing, Mission CTRL will demonstrate the practical benefits of doing
  what Jesus would do today in missions -- true charity -- and all boats will
  rise. Everyone likes those returns.
  
  Let's be clear: Mission CTRL is for everyone, and always will be, and there's
  no secret or cultish or weird agenda behind it. If you want to create an atheist mission to feed the hungry, please do so ASAP and I'll do my best to spend time on the ground as a missionary for that cause, if you'll have us.
  
  Otter: You know what?

  Fox: What?

  Otter: You share too much.

  Fox: I'm only sharing my background in order to explain a little about my
  peculiar relationship with technology, my respect for your individual
  freedom (in word, thought and deed), the guiding principles of the MetaMission, which are expressed in the acronym CTRL, and that I'm equipped to deploy on this mission and succeed -- with the support of Mission CTRL.

  Otter: Yawn. Where's Raven?

  Fox: Maybe Raven will say something later. She's busy.
  
  Otter: I really only came to see Raven.

  Fox: You mean my bird-wife?

  Otter: I'm asking the questions here.

  Fox: Hey, look, dinner's almost ready. Do you want to wrap this up and eat?

  Otter: You finally said something worth caring about. For that, you get one more question from me. Where can people follow up?

  Fox: You'll see us appearing soon in video Mission Logs, and we'll be in touch in Twitter Spaces and Discord chats.

  Thanks for reading, and may God's love be with you all.

Mission 1: Mission for Life
IRL      : Yes
Version  : 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Stage    : Pre-Planning

One small step for man... one giant leap for mother.

Mission Statement
  We affirm that abortion should never be chosen due to lack of financial
  support. We're dedicated to providing the financial support needed to
  prevent anyone from choosing abortion. Not only this, but we will establish
  places of refuge for people to raise their babies in family-oriented
  environments, which is to say, among families in Mission CTRL and deployed on
  this mission. Fathers welcome. If expectant parents want to give a family the
  gift of their new baby through adoption, we can do that too.

  Never again will we hear the argument that abortion is justifiable due to
  poverty or an unsupportive world.

  We desire to see billboards, funded by this mission, reading,
  
  "50,000,000 babies saved, and counting..."
  
  That would mean Mission CTRL saved the number of lives lost to abortion every year. It would also mean Mission CTRL celebrated 50,000,000 times, announcing each time to the world,
  
  "Folks, we're having a baby!"

  Now that's what we call Mission Accomplished.

  [img: Having a Cigar at Mission CTRL]

  Houston, we have a baby.

Villages of Hope
  While ending abortion is the driving focus of this mission, the scope of
  the Mission for Life is broad, and so it's also dedicated to helping people
  of any age or status who are lacking the special care they need to survive.

The locals are the families receiving help from Mission for Life.

The missionaries are the families present with the locals IRL and helping them on a daily basis.

Mission 2: Salton Sea Rescue
IRL      : Yes
Version  : 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Stage    : Planning

Mission Statement
  To help people living in a region devastated by poverty, extreme heat and
  the Salton Sea mega-disaster.
  
  [list of disgusting things]
  
  Windstorms frequently kick up these putrid toxins on the beaches of the
  receding Salton Sea, mixing with manure from intensive cattle farming in the
  surrounding area, creating a literal toxic shitstorm throughout the region
  that will leave a lasting impression on your clothes, in your hair, on your
  tongue, in your ears and nostrils.
  
  This is a wealthy civilization that can do much better.
  
  Needless to say, this is also one of the worst places on earth to raise a
  child, and these children, especially, need help today.
  
  This situation demands evacuation, but that's not practical for many people.
  We can help get them out, and we can also help to repair the damage done and
  restore the area to a level allowing for safe repopulation.
  
  To complicate matters enormously, we have now have the whole lithium
  situation. But first, some background on the Salton Sea.
  
Background
  
The Lithium Situation
  
Slab City
  They call it the last free place on earth...
    
Strategy
  Being the first mission for Mission CTRL that will get boots on the ground,
  this is also the proving ground of our general methodologies for any mission,
  and a time to hone them according to the MetaMission.
  
  We're organizing this particular mission as an outline because the execution
  plan fits into a tree structure with nested dependencies. Some (most?)
  missions will execution linearly, meaning that an outline format isn't
  needed, or even appropriate.
  
  At the highest level, the strategy is to first establish a friendly presence
  in Slab City, eventually empowering them to self-govern and thrive
  economically as well as personally. We believe our plan will encourage the
  vast majority of locals to join Mission CTRL and work at Level 3, putting all
  of us on the exact same mission.
  
  Establishing our base of operations in Slab City is the time for us to
  experiment, adapt and produce the solutions we'll need to serve the
  MetaMission worldwide. Before Builder's Paradise is ever opened for business,
  we want to build the useful and good things for Slab City itself first. That
  includes sanitation, housing, infrastructure and supply channels for
  import/export of goods.
  
  As soon as we're collectively producing solutions for Slab City, we want to
  apply them to the larger problems related to the Salton Sea crisis.

    1. Children - rewards for evacuating now with your children; diminishing rewards for staying with children; see Mission 1, especially if you're pregnant.

    1. Addicts - Earn rewards while recovering. See Mission 13. We believe this will be huge. Validators will be selected among the "locals," who are the missionary's loved ones.

      Potable water - hauling, bottling
      Composting toilets, humanure
      Household
        Air filtration systems
        Cooling - evaporative
        Water towers - pumps, solar hot water gravity systems, plumbing

        Electricity - wind, solar, inverters, batteries - no generators
        Propane - tanks, refills, hauling

      One word: Permaculture.
      Some R words: Reuse/Repair/Recycle/Repurpose
      One more word: Aquaponics.
      
    1. Food supply

  1. Builder's Paradise
    This is a business opportunity for Slabbers, based around SLABDAO. Slabbers
    lease the land and their builder services for this purpose. See Mission 6.
    
    Of all the people involved in Builder's Paradise, or affected by it, the
    locals have the most power, by design. For one thing, they control the
    spending of their Local Empowerment Fund, which funds Builder's Paradise.
    Furthermore, locals can vote by consensus at any time to scrap the whole
    endeavor for whatever reason.
    
    We advise codifying this policy into the MetaMission for all missions.

1. Please Evacuate the Area
  We need to clean up a mess. We'll help you move.

1. Salton Sea Restoration
  1. Remediation
    1. Note to builders: At some point during this mission, we'll want to conduct realtime monitoring and analysis of vital data in the field. Such jobs call for Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and D3.js is good for visualization.
    1. Robotics for decontamination... and lithium
      1. The Salton Sea Roomba
  1. Fill from Sea of Cortez
    
1. Reoccupation
  The mess has been remediated, and you can safely move back. We'll help you.

Mission 3: Develop Website and DAO
IRL      : No
Version  : 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Stage    : Planning

The website and DAO need more builders.

Front-end folks can begin by juicing up the static website, making some artwork and CSS involving any combination of space exploration, lunar lander, ground control type themes. Mission to Earth... Please, someone just make the website cool. Anything you do in JS will work, and you'll get to play around with a fun version of Jekyll in Haskell -- Hakyll.

Keep in mind that the static site will go away soon, replaced by the CTRL Panel, a single-page app. The idea is to reuse the theme from the for UX. The existing content, expressed as mission statements, will get normalized into the db and then fronted by a spiffy interface for collectively planning and operating missions like a boss.

In other areas of dev, it will be important to support realtime comms with all kinds of devices, protocols and networks. We should collaborate with projects doing decentralized wireless access.

We're using Haskell on the backend: Blaze, Nix, MongoDB, AWS.

As for the DAO, it runs on the Cardano blockchain and holds the treasury and manages supply. The DAO also manages governance and rewards according to Participation Levels, Voting Domains, Mission Funds, Local Empowerment Funds and Tip Funds.

Even more than this, our job is effectively to code the MetaMission into the
DAO, so that it algorithmically keeps the whole mission under control for us,
because history has proved that we can't be trusted to do it for ourselves.

We need to build Tip Jar functionality sooner than later, with tips going into the Tip Fund corresponding to each mission. The DAO will distribute tips regularly to the workers on those missions, including the builders of the website and DAO.

Mission 4: STAMP
IRL      : No
Version  : 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Stage    : Planning

We're making every location in the world a crypto-enabled internet access point
(albeit a very slow one). By doing so, we're introducing DePo: The
Decentralized Postal System, which is actually a decentralized courier and
shipping network.

---

Mission 5: Fugs
IRL      : No
Version  : 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Stage    : Planning

We're on a mission to migrate all the NFTs from Ethereum to Cardano, and to
have fun doing it. Go fuggers, go!

Mission 6: Builder's Paradise
IRL      : Yes
Version  : 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Stage    : Pre-Planning

Coming Soon: Design your dream projects and have them built IRL.

Projects dreamed up by anyone, anywhere, hosted and built by the friendly and
skillful locals in Slab City.

Brought to you by SLABDAO.

This mission requires a Launch Code from the Operations team on Mission 1,
certifying that SLABDAO is ready to support the deployment of this mission.
In addition to technical requirements, this decision, like everything else
done in the mission field, necessarily depends on the consent of locals, which
in this case, happens through SLABDAO.

Mission 9: The Haskell School of Haskell
IRL      : No
Version  : 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Stage    : Pre-Planning

Fun... Funny... Functional... Coincidence? No way.

We really put the fun in functional programming.

This experience in learning will blow your mind, and you'll die laughing.
  
We know that sounds awfully violent, but whatever. Come learn Haskell.

It's a crying shame that Haskell isn't owning the expression space, and when
I say expression, I mean all the artful ways people use computers to express
themselves: music, animation and video games.

That's why, in the Haskell School of Haskell, you get to choose your path(s) of
expression, and then get busy discovering all the ways you can get it done
expressively. We hope to prepare you to join us on a number of Haskell
missions, not only in the area of creative expression (see Missions 10), but
on stuff like blockchain

Mission 11: Help
IRL      : No

Sometimes we need help, and sometimes we can help each other. In every case, both parties benefit.

  Text interface.
  Social audio.
  Geospatial mobility.
  Narrative building.

  Games platform.
  Teaching platform.

It's a modern MUD, crypto-enabled.

Welcome to Help. For help, type help.

Mission 12: Man Up
IRL      : No

The self-improvement app for men, and the dating app for women to find them.

Mission 13: One Step Recovery
IRL      : Yes

Earn by recovering.

Take one step, and then keep going. You will see rewards while you walk the
walk to full recovery. 

In this mission of recovery, you are the one local resident and the people
in the world who love you are the missionaries helping you to achieve Mission
Accomplished. The more the missionaries achieve their goals for your
recovery along the way, the more rewards you will see, not only in your
crypto wallet, but in your life. We hope it will inspire you to become a
missionary after you recover.

Native utility token STEP is the one step you can take to receive the support
and loving generosity you'll need on this mission. As a local, you don't
purchase any STEP. STEP is made to benefit and empower you to self-govern and
do for yourself only what you can achieve through your own effort.

STEP is for everyone seeking full recovery, not only from substance abuse and
addiction, but any habitual patterns of thought and behavior that are causing
you to stumble and suffer, even threatening your life.

The one and only step to recovery is taking the first one, and STEP is here
to light the rest of your path.

This is a mission to develop STEPDAO, otherwise known as One Step Recovery,
or onestepr. Deployment of this mission will depend on a Launch Code from
Mission 1.

Mission 14: The RUG Pushers
IRL      : No

This is the opposite of a rug pull -- a mission to refund buyers for their
losses after catastrophic NFT rugs. The idea is to use staking rewards to build
up a free blockchain-wide insurance fund (only on Cardano).

[something about the most devastating rugs in crypto, with NFT jpgs, and recent rugs on Cardano]

The locals, in the case of this mission, are those who got rugged. If the RUG
Pushers determine that a rug has indeed defrauded customers, they'll get
reimbursed for the full amount of their losses, paid in RUG.

The missionaries are those who've been staking RUG in order to help shield
everyone from bad actors. As missionaries, they're getting an agreed Daily
Reward, and in this case it's a maximum profit for their staked RUG, with the
overflow profits going into the Local Empowerment Fund -- the bailout fund for
those who've been rugged (the locals).

Priority one for this mission is to establish mechanisms to hinder bad actors
in the first place. This mission also needs to prevent bad actors from gaming
the RUG Pushers themselves with false flag rugs (flugs?).

Ideally, this bailout fund will grow ever larger as our policies and
techniques for fighting fraud improve, and then we can fund all kinds of other
free insurance missions with it.

Mission 15: Decentralized Farming

DeFa - Decentralized Farming
IRL      : Yes

The cannabis industry is a train wreck, especially in the United States. Our mission is to remake and run the cannabis industry right, and even more than this, to give the indentured farmers of the world, whatever kind of natural harvest they're yielding, the full support they need to abandon the centralized system of exploitation and participate and prosper in the new DeFa economy like a boss.

There will be gleaning for all, and much celebrating for the harvest. And you know how Mission CTRL parties -- by giving gifts (see Mission Accomplished).

Of course, the farmers will need agricultural logistics and supply chains, etc., and that all of this must also adhere to permaculture principles. Permaculture is on MetaMission, big time. And if one member of the body isn't on mission, the whole body is injured.

The locals are the cannabis growers and everyone who helps bring their products to market, and then with future missions they'll be the wider agricultural industry, using this mission as a model (requiring our Launch Code).

The missionaries are those skilled in crypto and able to establish the native tokin' Hazy (HZY) and HZYDAO, the cannabis producers' own decentralized organization, built by this mission in the Development stage to adhere to permaculture principles and serve as a basis for similar missions. The missionaries are the ones introducing Hazy and onboarding the producers -- every day. This mission requires a lot of constant travel for missionaries, since you're setting up a new way to do global business -- the decentralized way -- and always according to the MetaMission. Basically, you're visiting growers, running crypto booths at cannabis conferences and cannabis booths at crypto conferences, visiting dispensaries, doing tons of IRL air drops of the Hazy, etc.

The drafter of this mission statement affirms that using a picture of his dog Hazel ("Hazy") as the head on coinage is advisable because she's adorable.

Mission 16: The Public Comms System (PCS)
IRL      : Yes

Free communications access for all.

Public high speed wireless, FM broadcasting, mobile decentralized PA using radios and megaphones...

-

Mission 17: The Corporate Wall Pattern
IRL      : Yes

A design pattern for decentralized anonymous commerce for entire communities using shell corporations. Otherwise known as shell corporations, but used for good.

It's defensive wall -- legally, commercially and physically.

Metaphor: Exchanging only through ports in the walls, with a full battery of defenses closely monitoring external activity from the watchtowers.

Localities under self-governance can use the Corporate Wall Pattern to hire outside, private security to provide physical self-defense patrols just outside their borders.

-

Mission 18: Invent the First Robotic Person (seriously)
IRL      : Yes

Or, Unveiling the Perfect Corporate Executive

We'll argue such at the SCOTUS hearings: That we have proved FORMALLY that our smart contracts execute the civil corporate law perfectly, not only qualifying them for the job of running corporations, but putting them above every other corporate executive in history in terms of performance. That means the corporation run only by robots should also be seen as a legal person, with the same rights as corporations run by crooks.

Smart contracts that serve in the executive and board positions. 

Are we creating our robot overlords here? God forbid. We're creating the legal equivalent of servers for the work that requires doing business at scale with the other servers/corporations (say, negotiating with centralized commercial suppliers on imports), and making it pluggable (for instance, adding an extension that understands how lumber is cut, sold and exported). The whole global corporate infrastructure could run according to the laws programmed into our smart contracts rather than according to the selfish whims of humans.

We're making the robots follow our corporate laws without fail, and meanwhile, empowering humans to build and direct those robots exactly like we build mission critical systems today for space missions.
